The tools in this folder are what I used to upload captions/subtitles to YouTube
and Universal Subtitles.

upload_captions.py will upload {youtube_id}.SRT caption files from the current
directory hierarchy to the corresponding YouTube video.  You will need the
password for the khanacademy YouTube account and a YouTube developer key for this
to work.

upload_unisubs.py will upload {youtube_id}.SRT caption files from the current 
directory hierarcy to the corresponding video on universalsubtitles.org.  You will
need an account on universalsubtitles.org for this to work. 

Please contact me with any questions.
