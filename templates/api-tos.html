If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor." You understand that any fact relating to any matter covered by this release may be found to be other than now believed to be true and you accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in fact.

Khan Academy will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

IN NO EVENT WILL KHAN ACADEMY’S LIABILITY EXCEED THE FEES PAYABLE BY YOU TO KHAN ACADEMY UNDER THESE API TERMS DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DAY THE ACT OR OMISSION OCCURRED THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM. </p> 

    	<p>CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF YOU RESIDE IS SUCH A JURISDICTION, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS. THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS OF WARRANTIES, REMEDIES OR LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THESE API TERMS APPLY TO YOU TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS ARE PERMITTED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTION WHERE YOU ARE LOCATED. </p>

    	<li id="15">15.	Waiver.  
    	<p> The failure of Khan Academy to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these API Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the API Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Khan Academy. </p>
        </li>

        <li id="16">16.	Severability. 
    	<p> If any provision of the API Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the API Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. </p>
        </li>

        <li id="17">17.	Survival.  
    	<p> Upon termination of the API Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 2, 4 through 8, and 11 through 20.
