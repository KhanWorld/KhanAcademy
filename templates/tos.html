            <li>17.1        Notice. Khan Academy may provide You with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail or postings on the Website. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after email is sent, unless Khan Academy is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give You legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by You through the Website. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing. Notice posted on the Website is deemed given 30 days following the initial posting.</li> 
            <li>17.2        Waiver. The failure of Khan Academy to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Khan Academy.</li> 
            <li>17.3        Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</li>
				<ol>
					<li>(a)   Governing Law. The Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.</li> 
					<li>(b)   Arbitration. For any claim related to the Terms or the Website, excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, where the total amount sought is less than ten thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00 USD), either Khan Academy or You may elect at any point in or during a dispute or proceeding to resolve the claim through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate it through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
					<li>(c)   Jurisdiction. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Terms or Khan Academy will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Santa Clara County, California, and You hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action, except as provided in Section 16.3(b) regarding arbitration. Notwithstanding this, either party shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce that party’s intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction where the other party resides or has its principal place of business.</li>
					<li>(d)   Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against Khan Academy must be resolved in accordance with this Section 17.3. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 17.3 shall be considered improperly filed. Should either party file a claim contrary to this Section 17.3, the other party may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to one thousand U.S. Dollars ($1,000.00 USD), provided that such party seeking such fees has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the other has failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</li>
				</ol>			
            <li>17.4        Severability. If any provision of the Terms or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</li>
            <li>17.5        Assignment. The Terms and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by You, but may be assigned by Khan Academy without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of the Terms shall be void.</li>
            <li>17.6        Survival. Upon termination of the Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, sections 5 through 16.</li>
            <li>17.7        Headings. The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of the Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.</li>

The Terms, the Privacy Policy and Guidelines constitute the entire agreement between You and Khan Academy relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to the Terms, Privacy Policy or Guidelines made by Khan Academy as set forth in Section 4 above.</li>
